For example, the imaginary number $i$ would be written as follows:\n",

For example, the position of a particle moving in one dimension in classical mechanics can take any value on the real line, so in this case, it is appropriate to use a `float` to represent its value when you're doing computations in Python.  On the other hand, in quantum mechanics, when one is taking linear combinations of basis vectors in the state space of a system, the coefficients in this linear combination can in general be complex numbers, so in this case it would be appropriate to use the `complex` number type for these coefficients."
