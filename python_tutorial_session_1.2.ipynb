    "During the course of the program, it's common to want the Python interpreter to choose what to do next based on whether certain conditions are met.  A [**control flow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) statement is a statement whose execution results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths should be followed.\n",

    "One can control how a program proceeds by using **logical statements**.  For example, if you want to tell the interpreter to print the value of `y` provided the value of another variable `x` is negative, you can use an `if` statement in your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if x < 0:\n",

    "There are a couple of important things to note about how this statement is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notice that the `if` statement on the first line ends with a colon, this is required for the interpreter to understand where the condition following the `if` ends.\n",
    "- The print statement on the second line is indented (by four spaces or a tab).  This is necessary for the Python interpreter to determine the **scope** of the if statement, namely which statements should be executed provided the condition following `if` is true.  This indented block for code can be of arbitrary length and therefore contain a program of arbitrary complexity."

    "Essentially every nontrivial, useful algorithm that one wishes to implement on a computer takes advantage of the fact that a computer can execute instructions in succession very quickly, and therefore a computer is an ideal device for performing repetitive tasks.  For example, if you wanted to manually compute the sum of all numbers from 1 to 1000 by brute force addition, starting from 1 and adding 2 then adding 3 etc., this would take quite a while.  But for a computer, especially a modern computer, this is a piece of cake.  In order to do this sort of thing, it's often appropriate to use a **loop**.  In python, there are two main kinds of loops that one might generally find useful: **for loops**, which tell python to repeat a certain code block according to a pre-specified list of steps, and **while loops** which tell python to repeat a code block as long as a certain condition evaluates to true.\n",
